# 🐢 Turtle Racing Game

This is a fun and interactive **Turtle Racing Game** built using Python's built-in `turtle` and `random` modules. The program simulates a race between colorful turtle racers, where the user can choose the number of participants (between 2 and 10), and the winner is determined randomly based on varying speeds.

## 🎮 How It Works

- The user is prompted to enter the number of turtle racers (between 2 and 10).
- Turtles of different colors are placed at the starting line.
- Each turtle moves forward by a random amount each iteration, making the race unpredictable.
- The first turtle to reach the top of the screen is declared the winner!

## 🛠️ Requirements

This project uses only Python standard libraries, so no external installations are needed.

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (included in standard Python)
- `random` and `time` modules (standard libraries)
